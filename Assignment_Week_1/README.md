 * Description: This project involves creating a simple application that
 *              performs statistical analytics on a dataset given as an array. 
 *              Functions are declared to analyze an array of unsigned char data 
 *              items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and
 *              median of the data set. And also to sort(reorder) the data set in 
 *              descending order (with the large value at the 0th index and smallest 
 *              value in the n-1 th index).
 *
 * It will consist of eight functions:
 *
 * main() - The main entry point for your program
 *
 * print_statistics() - A function that prints the statistics of an array 
 * including minimum, maximum, mean, and median.
 *
 * print_array()- Given an array of data and a length, prints the array to the 
 *                screen.
 *
 * find_median()- Given an array of data and a length, returns the median value.
 *
 * find_mean()- Given an array of data and a length, returns the mean.
 *
 * find_maximum()- Given an array of data and a length, returns the maximum.
 *
 * find_minimum()- Given an array of data and a length, returns the minimum.
 *
 * sort_array()- Given an array of data and a length, sorts the array from 
 *               largest to smallest.
